== About me
 I am now a master in [http://sc.neu.edu.cn/ Software College][http://www.neu.edu.cn/ Northeastern University (NEU)], under the supervision of Prof.[https://guoguibing.github.io/ Guibing Guo] and co-supervision of Prof.[https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/zhu-sun Zhu Sun]. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng degree from [http://ise.ysu.edu.cn/ Information Science and Engineering College] in [https://www.ysu.edu.cn/ YanShan University (YSU)], 2018.
 

== Research interest
My research topics include 
- Recommender System (e.g. sequential recommendation, session-based recommendation, etc.)
- Data mining (e.g. information retrival)
- Machine Learning techniques (e.g. deep learning)\n

But my research interests are not limited to the topics above, I am also curious about human language (e.g. question answering, dialogue generation, etc.) and interpretable  machine learning.
